## What I learned

Regarding the JavaScript, this is probably the most complicated project I have completed so far. I found myself writing JS code then adding comments later to remind myself what it did. I think in future projects I will try writing the comments first so that the logic is in place to start with and then try writing the code once I have set out exactly what I am trying to achieve with each step.
